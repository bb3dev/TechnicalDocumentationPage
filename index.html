            <p>At its heart, HTML is a fairly simple language made up of elements, which can be applied to pieces of
                text to give them different meaning in a document , structure a document into logical sections , and
                embed content such as images and videos into a page. <code></code> Before starting, you
                don't need any previous HTML knowledge, but you should have at least basic familiarity with using
                computers and using the web passively...  </p>
             <ul>
                 <li>For example, just looking at it and consuming content on the web.</li>
                 <li>You should have a basic work environment set up. (Web browser and a text editor) </li>
                 <li>Also understand how to create and manage files.</li>
             </ul>   
            <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages — for example, to alter the font, color, size and spacing of your content, split it
                into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features. Before starting, you
                should have:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Basic familiarity with using computers, and using the Web passively.</li>
                <li>A basic work environment set up as detailed in Installing basic software, and an understanding of
                    how to create and manage files.</li>
                <li>Basic familiarity with HTML.</li>

                 <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
             <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language; it is a markup language used to tell
                 your browser how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web
                 developer wishes it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or
                 mark up different parts of the content to make it appear or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can
                 make a bit of content into a hyperlink to link to another page on the web, italicize words, and so on.
                 For example, take the following line of content: <br>My puppy is afraid of everything that moves.
                 <br>
                 <code>&lt;p&gt;My puppy is afraid of everything that moves.&lt;/p&gt;</code></p>
                 <p>**Note: Tags in HTML are case-insensitive, i.e. they can be written in uppercase or lowercase. For
                     example, a &lt;title&gt; tag could be written as &lt;title&gt;, &lt;TITLE&gt;, &lt;Title&gt;,
                     &lt;TiTlE&gt;, etc., and it will work fine. Best practice, however, is to write all tags in lowercase for consistency, readability other reasons.**</p>

                  <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
              <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how
                  they are styled, laid out,
                  etc. It allows you to create great looking web pages, but how does it work under
                  the hood? How does the browser turn HTML into a Document Object Model
                  (DOM), how is CSS applied to parts of the DOM, and what code is used
                  to actually include our CSS in our web page?
                  <br>A CSS stylesheet is applied to the HTML using a &lt;link&gt; element within the &lt;head&gt; tag. For example:
                  <code> &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"&gt;</code></p>
                  <h2>How does CSS affect HTML?</h2>
                  <p>Web browsers apply CSS rules to a document to affect how they are displayed. A set of CSS rules
                      contained within a stylesheet determines how a webpage should look. A CSS rule is formed
                      from:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>A set of <strong>properties</strong>, which have values set to update how the HTML content is
                      displayed, for
                      example, I want my element's width to be 50% of its parent element, and its background to be red.
                  </li>
                  <li>A <strong>selector</strong>, which selects the element(s) you want to apply the updated property
                      values to. For
                      example, I want to apply my CSS rule to all the paragraphs in my HTML document.</li>

                   <h2>The Anatomy of an HTML Element</h2>
                    <p>Lets explore the paragraph element a bit...
                        <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;</code>
                    </p>

                   <p>The main parts of this element are:</p>
                   <ol>
                       <li>The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in
                           opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take
                           effect — in this case where the start of the paragraph is.</li>
                       <li>The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash
                           before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the end of
                           the paragraph is. Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error and can lead to
                           strange results.</li>
                       <li>The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case is just text.</li>
                       <li>The element: The opening tag plus the closing tag plus the content equals the element.</li>
                   </ol>

                <h2>The Anatomy of a CSS Property</h2>
                <p>First of all, let's take a simple HTML document, containing an &lt;h1&gt; and a &lt;p&gt; (notice
                    that a stylesheet is applied to the HTML using a &lt;link&gt; element):
                            <br>
                            <code>
                                &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
                                &lt;html&gt;

                                &lt;head&gt;
                                    &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
                                    &lt;title&gt;My CSS experiment&lt;/title&gt;
                                    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"&gt;
                                &lt;/head&gt;

                                &lt;body&gt;
                                    &lt;h1&lt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;
                                    &lt;p&gt;This is my first CSS example&lt;/p&gt;
                                &lt;/body&gt;

                                &lt;/html&gt;
                            </code><br></p>
                            <p>Now let's look at a very simple CSS example containing two rules:
                                <code>h1 {
                                    color: blue;
                                    background-color: yellow;
                                    border: 1px solid black;
                                    }
                                    p {
                                        color: red;
                                    }</code>
                            </p>
                            <p>The first rule starts with an h1 selector, which means that it will apply its property
                                values to the &lt;h1&gt; element. It contains three properties and their values (each
                                property/value pair is called a declaration):</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>The first one sets the text color to blue.</li>
                                    <li>The second sets the background color to yellow.</li>
                                    <li>The third one puts a border around the header that is 1 pixel wide, solid (not
                                        dotted, or dashed, etc.), and colored black.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>The second rule starts with a p selector, which means that it will apply its property
                                    values to the &lt;p&gt; element. It contains one declaration, which sets the text color to
                                    red. In a web browser, the code above would produce the following output:</p>
